  <h3>Inspection Process</h3>
    <p>Returns come in in daily. We receive packages from USPS, FedEx and UPS and they are typically received inside the big green gaylord at the third dock door. You can pick these packages up using a cart or buggy and bring them to the returns area in the back of the warehouse. During peak times these packages will need to be seperated by date of arrival.</p>
    <p>Carefully open packages using scissors or box cutters. Be very careful not to accidentally damage items inside packages when opening. It's best to make a small opening and carefully make wider. </p>
    <p>Once your package is open lay out items carefully. Do</p>

  <h3>Bunny Games</h3>
  <p><b><i>Bunnies require mental and physical stimulation in order to be happy. The following are games you can play:</i></b></p>
<p>The Nibble and Sprint: Take a small bunch of tasty, scented greens – such as parsley – and sit near your bunnies. Let them come over to investigate and reward them with a little nibble. Then move to another spot and call your rabbits’ names and, when they follow, offer them another tasty titbit. </p>
<p>Magic Cups: Take two to three plastic cups (transparent for beginners), your bun’s favourite food, and sit down with your pets. Extra tasty herbs can work well for this game. Place a little food inside the cups and put them upside down on the ground. Now encourage your bunnies to come over to investigate and to get the treat out </p>
<p>The Hopping Challenge: Build a low wall out of cardboard boxes, such as the ones fizzy drink cans come in, and encourage your buns to hop over them by repeating the word “hop” and holding a tasty treat in front of them. When they make the leap, reward them with the treat, along with lots of praise.</p>
